# Neural Foil Aerospace Project 

## What it is
AI meets aerospace! This project uses **neural networks** to predict and optimize **foil designs** for better lift, drag, and performance in aircraft and UAVs.

## Features
- Predicts aerodynamic parameters  
- Optimizes foil shapes  
- Visualizes results  

## Tech
Python | TensorFlow/PyTorch | NumPy | Matplotlib | XFoil/OpenFOAM  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Showvik2405/Aerospace_Project_With_NeuralFoi
pip install -r requirements.txt
